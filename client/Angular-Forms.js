//. Angular Template Forms
/// Forms Module & ReactiveFormsModule

//: How it works
//> AbstractControlClass is the base for the following classes: --> ID005.png
//@ FormControl
//@ FormGroup
//@ FormArray

//> Instances of these classes are bound to the inputs in the template and track their state
//> FormControlName is the bind between the FormControl & Element
//> In Angular, all standard elements implement ControlValueAccessor to gain access to the element
//> An interface whicg acts as a bridge between the Angular forms API & a native elemnt in the DOM
